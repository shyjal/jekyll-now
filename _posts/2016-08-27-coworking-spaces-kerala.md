title: Coworking spaces in Kerala
---

In this new age,the concept of having an office space is changing. Especially for Startup / IT people where all it need is a space to place laptop, a seat, and a decent internet connection.Past two weeks have been very interesting. I got an opportunity to experience different co-working spaces in major cities of Kerala, the southern state of India. I would like to share my experience working from co-working hubs in Cochin, Calicut and Trivandrum. The journey was quite amazing, where I met many freelancers and startup guys.

In my view coworking spaces keep you more productive and happier than regular workplaces.You are surrounded by other professionals working on their projects in a hostility-free and friendly environment, which encourages you to focus on your work, and with whom you can discuss and exchange ideas, and improve your business, life, and community.

## Cochin
The fast growing Ernakulam city has always been the center of business and startups when it comes to Kerala. I have stayed here for three days where i used one coworking hub each day.
### 1. Alappat Center A
The one thing that differentiates Center A from all other coworking hubs I have visited is the class and the location. It’s located in mg road, mostly known as the heart of the city and the infrastructure they offer is world class. Price is bit high while comparing others but I think that’s worthy.

They have meeting rooms, enclosed offices, coworking hubs. Coworkers can either work from an enclosed common area or the roof top cafe. I was working from roof top sky cafe, There is a small coffee shop, foosball table, most of all the view from the 8th floor is great.

Special thanks to Mr. Joy Alappat who offered me a free trial that day.

### 2. Kerala technology innovation zone ( Former startup village )
This space is not open to general public rite now. Former startup village’s common space was pretty good. They stopped this after converting to KTIZ under kerala startup mission.

One option available now is to be the guest of existing startups incubated there physically. I have worked from KTIZ as a guest of my friend’s startup http://www.yatramantra.com. Space is not that great when comparing, but the people / culture there is still awesome.

### 3. Creative cube
Spend my last day in cochin working from creative cube’s Kakkanad space. In fact, they have three hubs in cochin. The main one is in Panampilly nagar, where I think the interior is more cool. the other two are villas, not so bad to work from.

## Trivandrum
This is a city which always disappoints me. Other than the fact that it’s the capital city and the nice roads i found nothing special in this city. I have been to Trivandrum in search of coworking hubs. Searched online , Asked many freelancers, techies, startup guys but none knows any coworking space. Some suggested few companies in technopark and outside subleasing their space, which I felt is not a good option and I ended up working from my friends flat.

## Calicut
My home town where I started this journey. It was actually surprising for me realising the growth of kozhikode in this area.

### 1. Flewhub
Funded by flewup technologies and located inside hilite business park near city’s largest mall — hilite. The working of this space is a bit different tho. I found PC installed in each seat also the people which I met there are different. Few guys work like each one compliment skills p2p on their projects. Also they have a quarterly pitching event for budding entrepreneurs named flew conclave, Aliriza, Chairman told they have a network of investors participating this event.

### 2. Spacebar
This space is more like a 2 bhk flat. But the ambience was really great. Founded by two freelancers based on calicut. Spacebar has one dedicated room which is already taken by some team, another one is the common place where I was working.
